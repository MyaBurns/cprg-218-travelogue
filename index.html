<h2>Osoyoos, BC</h2>

        <p>Osoyoos is a town in British Columbia that I visit through the summer as my grandparents have a condo there. It has a small town charm, quaint stores, and a small amusement park called Rattlesnake Canyon. My favourite attraction at Rattlesnake Canyon is the mini golf course. Additionally, it has go-carts, water bumper cars, and an arcade. For those who have never been to Osoyoos, but are interested in going, I recommend that they specifically shop at California Days, Beach Chik, and Home Hardware. The Home Hardware in Osoyoos is unique as it sells a large variety of essentially everything.</p>

         <P>Another recommendation I have for someone visiting Osoyoos is taking a walk through the vineyards at the Spirit Ridge resort to Lake Osoyoos to hangout by the beach, and have dinner at the Cantina. This restaurant has great food, and has live  music shows.</p>

    <h2>Sicamous, BC</h2>
    

    <p>Sicamous is a town in the Shuswap Country of British Columbia. Although the town itself is not large, I spend a lot of time at Mara Lake, as my uncle has a cabin right on the water. Through the summers, my family and I would go Zup boarding on my uncle’s boat, and play around with the paddle boards. For someone who has never been to Sicamous, but is interested in going, I recommend spending lots of time by and on the water, whether that’s staying on the beach, or using a paddle board or boat to go out into the water.</p>

            <figcaption>Mara Lake</figcaption>

        <p>Additionally, I highly recommend a trip to the Dutchmen Dairy. The Dutchmen Dairy has pastries, icecream, and other dairy products made on site. You can also walk through the barns to see the cows, and other farm animals such as chickens and pigs. And, while you visit the dairy, Fruit World is another spot I recommend visiting as it is right across the street from Dutchmen’s Dairy. Fruit World has delicious fruit for a good price at a high quantity.</p>

    <h2>Orlando, Florida</h2>

    <p>Orlando is a large city with many attractions that make it a great vacation spot. However, for someone visiting for the first time, some must-see-spots include Disney Springs, the Lake Apopka Wildlife Drive, and Epcot. My favourite part about Disney Springs was eating at the themed restaurants. Disney Springs has a dinosaur themed restaurant in which there are “meteor showers” every 15 minutes, and the famous Rainforest Cafe. Also, the Wildlife Drive is a roughly 2 hour drive through the swamps of Florida where you can see alligators and a variety of interesting birds.</p>

            <figcaption>Epcot</figcaption>
</figure>
        
    <p>Lastly, Epcot is a part of the Disney Parks that takes you around the world. I found it highly interesting to see the depiction of Canada and famous landmarks from around the world!</p>
